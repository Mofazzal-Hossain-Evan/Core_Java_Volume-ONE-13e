 * =========================
 * [From Core Java, Ch 3 & 6]
 * Interfaces define a contract of methods that a class (or record) must implement.
 * Sealed interfaces (Java 17+) allow limiting which classes or records can implement it.
 * Great for controlling hierarchies â€” especially in large systems.
