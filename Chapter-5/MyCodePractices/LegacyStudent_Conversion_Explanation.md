# 🔍 Explanation: LegacyStudent to ModernStudent Conversion

This document explains the following code snippet used in a raw-to-typed `ArrayList` conversion context:

```java
LegacyStudent ls = (LegacyStudent) obj;
ModernStudent ms = new ModernStudent(ls.getName(), ls.getRoll());
```

---

## 📌 Scenario

You are working with a **raw ArrayList** (no generics), which might contain different object types (like `LegacyStudent`, `String`, etc.).

```java
ArrayList rawList = legacySystem.getRawStudentRecords();
for (Object obj : rawList) {
    if (obj instanceof LegacyStudent) {
        LegacyStudent ls = (LegacyStudent) obj;
        ModernStudent ms = new ModernStudent(ls.getName(), ls.getRoll());
        ...
    }
}
```

---

## 🔍 Line 1: Type Casting

### `LegacyStudent ls = (LegacyStudent) obj;`

- `obj` is an element from the raw list.
- Since the list is raw, each item is treated as an `Object`.
- We assume it is a `LegacyStudent`, so we cast it:
  ```java
  (LegacyStudent) obj
  ```
- This is a **runtime cast**. If the actual object is not a `LegacyStudent`, it throws `ClassCastException`.

---

## 🔍 Line 2: Creating ModernStudent

### `ModernStudent ms = new ModernStudent(ls.getName(), ls.getRoll());`

- Once casted to `LegacyStudent`, we can safely get the name and roll.
- We then create a new `ModernStudent` using this data.
- This demonstrates converting legacy-style data to a modern typed object.

---

## 🔄 Example

If `obj = new LegacyStudent("Rahim", 101);`

```java
LegacyStudent ls = (LegacyStudent) obj; // ✅ successful cast
String name = ls.getName();             // "Rahim"
int roll = ls.getRoll();                // 101

ModernStudent ms = new ModernStudent(name, roll); // ✅ new typed student
```

---

## ⚠️ Danger of Wrong Type

If `obj = "Corrupted data";`

```java
LegacyStudent ls = (LegacyStudent) obj; // ❌ ClassCastException at runtime
```

That's why we always check:

```java
if (obj instanceof LegacyStudent)
```

---

## ✅ Summary

| Line | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `LegacyStudent ls = (LegacyStudent) obj;` | Cast raw object to expected type |
| `ModernStudent ms = new ModernStudent(...)` | Create typed student object from legacy data |

---

## ✅ Safer Alternative

You can extend `LegacyStudent` or use composition to avoid manually copying fields.
